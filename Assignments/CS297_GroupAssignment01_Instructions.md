<h1>Group Assignment 1 Instructions</h1>

**CS 297, Software Development Capstone**

1. Set up Git repository for your team's project on GitHub.

   - Create a docs folder and add the following:
     - A .gitignore file for Visual Studio
     - Updated design documents from the System Design class:
       - Project proposal
       - UI wireframes
       - Domain model UML diagram
     - Team collaboration contract.

   - Â Paste a link to your repository into the online text for this assignment on Moodle.

2. In your sprint planning meeting, revise your first sprint

   (If your team didn't set up a Jira project and put user stories into the first sprint backlog in the System Design class, do it now.)

   - Assign each user story to a developer.
   - The assigned developer will break their user stories down into *sub-tasks* by adding *child issues.*
   - Make estimates for the user stories. You can do this individually or as a team, or a little of both.
     - For this sprint estimate 1 story point = 1 hour.
     - Estimate the sub-tasks first, then the sum of the sub-task story points will be the user story estimate.
     - Add up the total story points for this sprint. If it comes up to more than 8 times the number of developers, then you need to remove one or more user stories.
   - Paste a link to your Jira project into the online text for this assignment.
