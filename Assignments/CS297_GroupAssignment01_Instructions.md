<h1>Group Assignment 1 Instructions</h1>

**CS 297, Software Development Capstone**

1. Set up Git repository for your team's project on GitHub.  
   Don't reuse the one you created for your prototype, make a new one.

   1. A .gitignore file for Visual Studio  
     This needs to be in the first commit to the repository in order to be effective.

   2. Create a docs folder and add the following:
     - Updated design documents from the System Design class:
       - Project proposal
       - UI wireframes
       - Domain model UML diagram  
         Revise this to reflect any feedback you got when it was graded.
     - Team collaboration contract.

   3. Paste a link to your repository into the online text for this assignment on Moodle.

2. In your sprint planning meeting, revise your first sprint.

   (If your team didn't set up a Jira project and put user stories into the first sprint backlog in the System Design class, do it now.)

   - Review the user stories in your project backlog
     - If you got feedback suggesting changes when they were graded make the changes now.
     - You've had a break, look over your backlog with fresh eyes and see if there are any missing user stories, or user stories that should be revised.

   - Assign each user story to a developer.
   - The assigned developer will break their user stories down into *sub-tasks* by adding *child issues.*
   - Make estimates for the user stories. You can do this individually or as a team, or a little of both.
     - For this sprint estimate 1 story point = 1 hour.
     - Estimate the sub-tasks first, then the sum of the sub-task story points will be the user story estimate.
     - Add up the total story points for this sprint. If it comes up to more than 8 times the number of developers, then you need to remove one or more user stories.
   - Paste a link to your Jira project into the online text for this assignment.
