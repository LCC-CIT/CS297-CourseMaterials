Today we will      discuss all that is involved in an alpha release<br>      <h2>What is an Alpha Release?</h2>      <p><b>Purpose of an alpha release</b></p>      <ul>        <li>Get early feedback on usability from potential end-users and other          stake holders</li>        <li>Get bug reports from potential end users as opposed to just testers<br>          In this context, we mean that we won't be using just software or game          dev type people for testing. We'll be releasing the product to average          people who would be likely to use the product</li>        <li>Motivation to get your project to a usable state</li>      </ul>      <p><b>Characteristics of an alpha release</b></p>      <ul>        <li>A minimal set of features implemented<br>          Not all the features will be done, but a minimal set of the most          important features will be at least partially working. These features          should be working well enough that users can actually use the          application or game in some basic way.</li>        <li>Still has bugs<br>          There will be both known and unknown bugs. Give the testers a list of          the known bugs.</li>        <li>You should start using some form of bug tracking at this point <br>          You can enter bugs in your agile project management system and          identify them as "issues" or "bugs" to distinguish them from<i> user            stories</i>.</li>      </ul>      <p><b>Real life story</b></p>      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">At Intel Architecture Labs:</div>      <ul>        <li>Contrast the testing done by the QA department to alpha testing done          by "real world" users.</li>        <li>E-mail auto-sorting feature that passed QA but failed alpha testing.</li>      </ul>      <ul>      </ul>      <h2>Team Assignment </h2>      <ul>      </ul>      Each team member will make at least one post to the forum. Be sure to      address each of the points below:<br>      <ul>        <li>A UX survey. (updated from the UX testing assignment)<br>          Just the survey not the results. You will present the results in your          report next week.</li>        <li>A test procedure. (updated from the functional testing assignment)<br>          This will be an extension of the one you submitted for the Functional          Testing assignment. Again, this is just the test procedure, not the          results.</li>        <li>A list of alpha evaluators (aka alpha testers). <br>          This will be an update to the list you submitted for the Functional          Testing assignment. Try to recruit as many non-programmer alpha          evaporators as you can.</li>        <li>A list of features ready for testing</li>      </ul>      <p>Each team member will be graded on their post<b> </b></p>      <article id="Instructions2019">        <p><b>Revised instructions for 2019</b></p>        Each team member will make at least one post to the forum. Each of the        documents below should be posted.<br>        <ul>          <li>A UX survey. (updated from the UX testing assignment)<br>            Just the survey not the results. You will present the results in            your report next week.</li>          <li>A test procedure. (updated from the functional testing assignment)<br>            This procedure should cover all the features that are now working in            the alpha version of your project. Again, this is just the test            procedure, not the results.</li>          <li>A list of alpha testers<br>            This will be an update to the list you submitted for the Functional            Testing assignment. You should have at least four testers who are            not members of your team, clients, or sponsors. At least two should            be non-programmers / non-game designers.</li>          <li>An updated version of your design document. This update will            reflect changes you have made to the design of your project.</li>        </ul>        Each team member will be graded on their post </article>      <h2>Next week's Assignment: Alpha Project Presentation</h2>      <p>In week 7, you will report on the same things that you will report on        for the final presentation. Think of this as practice for your final        presentation. </p>      <ul>      </ul>      <h2> References</h2>      <a href="https://www.centercode.com/blog/2011/01/alpha-vs-beta-testing" target="_blank">Alpha
