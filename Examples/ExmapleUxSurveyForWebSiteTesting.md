### Example UX Questions for Live Web Site Testing

**CS 297: Capstone**

This is a general list of questions to ask potential users who are testing a live web site. You can use these questions as an inspiration for your own, or start with these and add, remove or modify the questions to fit your particular site design. These questions could be used in a survey or an interview.

**General Impressions**

- **Clarity of Purpose:** Does each web page's purpose seem clear as you interact with it? 
- **Consistency:** Are design elements (e.g., navigation, buttons, headings) consistent across the web pages as you navigate through the site?
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Does each web page effectively highlight the most important elements on the page as you view and interact with it?
- **First Impressions:** What is your first impression of the web pages? 
- **Credibility/Trustworthiness:** Does this website appear credible and trustworthy? 
- **Overall Satisfaction:** How satisfied are you with the overall look and feel of the website? 

**Navigation and Layout**

- **Navigation Clarity:** How easy is it to understand how to navigate between different pages or sections of pages?
- **Navigation Efficiency:** How quickly and easily were you able to find information you were looking for using the navigation?
- **Intuitive Layout:** How easy was it to find the information you were looking for within the individual pages? (Focusing on the live page content)
- **Responsiveness (if applicable):** If you viewed this on different screen sizes (e.g., desktop, mobile), how well did the layout adapt?

**Content and Labeling**

- **Button Labels:** Are button labels clear and descriptive of their function?
- **Headings and Titles:** Are headings and titles appropriately descriptive?
- **Call-to-Action:** Are calls-to-action (e.g., "Sign Up," "Learn More") prominent and clear and do you understand what will happen when you click them?
- **Content Clarity:** Is the text content on the pages easy to understand?
- **Information Accuracy:** Does the information presented on the website seem accurate and up-to-date?

**Functionality**

- **Interactivity:** Is the purpose of interactive elements (e.g., links, buttons, forms) clear as you interact with them? Did they behave as you expected?
- **Error Prevention:** Did you encounter any elements that confused you or led to errors while using the website?
- **Form Usability (if applicable):** If you interacted with any forms, were they easy to understand and complete?
- **Search Functionality (if applicable):** If you used the search function, were the results relevant and helpful?
- **Performance:** Did the website load quickly and respond smoothly to your actions?

**Overall Feedback**

- **Strengths:** What do you think are the strengths of this website? 
- **Improvements:** What areas of this website do you think need improvement? 
- **Would Recommend:** Would you recommend this website to a friend or colleague? Why or why not?
- **Key Takeaways:** What are your key takeaways or impressions after using the website?

**Tips for Guiding Users in a Live Website Test:**

- **Task-Based Scenarios:** Instead of just showing pages, give users specific tasks to complete (e.g., "Find the contact information," "Add a product to your cart"). The survey questions can then be tied to their success and experience with these tasks.
- **Open-Ended Questions:** Include more open-ended questions to encourage detailed feedback beyond simple "yes" or "no" answers.
- **Think-Aloud Protocol:** Consider asking users to verbalize their thoughts and actions as they navigate the live site. This provides valuable qualitative data that can supplement the survey responses.
- **Screen Recording/Heatmaps:** Tools that record user sessions and track their clicks can provide objective data to complement the survey feedback.
- **Demographic Information (Optional):** You might want to collect basic demographic information (age, technical proficiency, etc.) to identify patterns in the feedback.
