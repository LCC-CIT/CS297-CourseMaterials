# Changes to Make for 2025

## Week 1

Git: Give a tutorial on the Git Branch workflow and how to do PRs, mreges and resolve merge conflicts.

Team work sessions: Make a clear difinition of what "team work sessions are". 
Sprint planning: emphasize that one person should do a whole "vertical slice" view + controller (+ model changes, but only after consulting the team).

New project: Remind them they can use the project template that includes identity.

Put everyone on the same Discord server, so I can moderate.

Reports: get a team report on sprint planning and work sessions (work sessions will include daily standups).

## Week 2

Identity scaffolding: give the tutorial.

Servers: Set up staging and production servers.
