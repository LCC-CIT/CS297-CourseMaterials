# Changes to Make for 2025

## Week 1

Git: Give a tutorial on the Git Branch workflow and how to do PRs, mreges and resolve merge conflicts.

Team work sessions: Make a clear difinition of what "team work sessions are". 

Put everyone on the same Discord server, so I can moderate.

Reports: get a team report on sprint planning and work sessions (work sessions will include daily standups).
