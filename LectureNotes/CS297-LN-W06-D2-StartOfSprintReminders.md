## Sprint Meetings

Keep them short and to the point.

- Sprint plannnig should just be about primoritizing, and moving backlog into the current sprint.
  - Bugs and non-user-story tasks may also need to be added.
  - You may also need to:
    - Add any missing user stories.
    - Do some new design.
- Daily standups should just be for each team member to answer the three stock questions.
  - Not of problem solving.
  - Not for giving advice or opinions.
- Sprint Product Review
  - Focus on getting feedback from the client.
- Sprint retrospective
  - Ask the three questions
  - Keep everything positive, constructive, and relevant.

## Pull Requests

- Should be for just one user story; unless there are two stories that are interdependnt and can't be implmented separately.
  - Include the user story ID number
- Should reference a functional and/or integration or unit test.
- Can be for a bug fix.
