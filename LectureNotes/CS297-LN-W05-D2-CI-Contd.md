## Creating a GitHub Actions Workflow File in YAML

The script that defines what GitHub Actions will do for you will be a file written in YAML (YAML is a bit like JSON without curly braces).

- Create a directory in your repository with this path: `.github/workflows`
- Create a workflow file by creating text file with the extension `.yaml` and name it something descriptive, like: `ci-workflow.yaml`
- The easiest way to edit this file is to use Visual Studio Code with an extension that provides help writing GitHub Actions yaml files.
  - I'm using GitHub Actions v0.24.1 by Christopher Schleiden. It has been downloaded 77, 595 times and is rated 5 stars with 14 reviews.
  - I'm using GitHub`v0.30.7`by KnisterPeter with 865,974 downloads and rated 5 stars with 8 reviews. This extension Integrates github and its workflows into vscode.
  - The extension provides GitHub Actions context sensitive documentation and auto-completion suggestions using the correct syntax and key words.
  - You need to create a new [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) and register it in the extension. 
    - On GitHub, go to your login profile (the circle containing your picture or avatar in the upper right-hand corner of the page), select "Settings" and follow these [instructions to create a token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-token).
      - Select all the scopes for "repo".
    - In VS Code, press Ctrl+Shift+p to open the command palette and type `GitHub: Set Personal Access Token`. You will then be prompted to enter the token generated from GitHub.

##### Example YAML workflow file

The example below will build and test a .NET app whenever a PR is opened to merge code into the main branch. This file was autogenerated by GitHub.

```YAML
 pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Setup .NET
      uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v2
      with:
        dotnet-version: 5.0.x
    - name: Restore dependencies
      run: dotnet restore
    - name: Build
      run: dotnet build --no-restore
    - name: Test
      run: dotnet test --no-build --verbosity normal

```



## Next Time

In a future session, we will write some YAML workflows and experiment with several different triggers for building and testing code.
