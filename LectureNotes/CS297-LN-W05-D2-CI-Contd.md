## Creating a GitHub Actions Workflow File in YAML

The script that defines what GitHub Actions will do for you will be a file written in YAML (YAML is a bit like JSON without curly braces).

- Create a directory in your repository with this path:
  `.github/workflows`
- Create a workflow file by creating a text file with the extension `.yaml` and give it a name, like:
  `ci-workflow.yaml`
- The easiest way to edit this file is to use Visual Studio Code with an extension that provides help writing GitHub Actions yaml files. I've tried these three:
  - YAML v1.7.0 by Red Hat. <u>This one works quite well!</u>
  - GitHub Actions v0.24.1 by Christopher Schleiden. This worked, but provided somewhat minimal syntax checking.
  - GitHub`v0.30.7`by KnisterPeter. Even after providing the app with a GitHub Personal Authentication Token, I didn't get any help with my yaml file.

### YAML Syntax

#### File Beginning and End

YAML files start with `---` and end with `...`

#### Data

There are two types of data in a yaml file, key-value pairs (aka dictionaries) and lists (aka arrays).

- Key-value pairs: use a colon to separate the key and value. 
  For example: `name: CI`

- Arrays: multiple items prefixed with a dash. For example:
  ```yaml
  - Squash
  - Cucumber
  - Potato
  ```

- Mix of key-value pairs and arrays. Example:
  ```
  - Vegetables:
  	- Squash
  	- Cucumber
  	- Potato
  - Fruit:
  	- Apple
  	- Orange
  	- Bannana
  ```

### Parts of an Actions Workflow

#### on

Specifies a trigger for the workflow. [Here is a list of triggers](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows).

#### steps

Tasks to execute when running a job.

#### jobs

A job is a set of steps in a workflow that execute on the same runner.

#### uses

This is where we describe the actions that will be taken. We find the actions that are possible in the [GitHub Actions Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions). Here are the ones we are using:

- [checkout](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/checkout)
- [setup-dotnet](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-dotnet)



##### Example YAML workflow file

The example below will build and test a .NET app whenever a PR is opened to merge code into the main branch. This file was autogenerated by GitHub.

```YAML
 pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Setup .NET
      uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v2
      with:
        dotnet-version: 5.0.x
    - name: Restore dependencies
      run: dotnet restore
    - name: Build
      run: dotnet build --no-restore
    - name: Test
      run: dotnet test --no-build --verbosity normal

```



## Next Time

In a future session, we will write some YAML workflows and experiment with several different triggers for building and testing code.
