[TOC]

## Scrum Roles

### Product owner

For the web dev teams, this is your client.

- Define the features of the product.
- Decide on release date and content.
- Be responsible for the profitability of the product (ROI).
- Prioritize features according to market value.
- Adjust features and priority every iteration, as needed.
- Accept or reject work results.

### ScrumMaster

- Represents management (or in the case of this class, your instructor) to the project.
- Responsible for enacting Scrum values and practices.
- Removes impediments.
- Ensures that the team is fully functional and productive.
- Enables close cooperation across all roles and functions.
- Shields the team from external interferences.

### Team

- Typically 5-9 people in the "real world", 3 to 4 in our class.
- Cross-functional:
  Programmers, testers, user experience designers, etc.
- Members should be full-time in the "real world".
- Teams are self-organizing&mdash;Ideally. No titles, but occasionally a possibility (like lead developer).



## Scrum Meetings

During each sprint you will hold these meetings (aka "ceremonies").

### Sprint planning meeting

- Sprint Prioritization
  - Analyze and evaluate product backlog.
  - Select sprint goal. What feature (or features) will be usable at the end of the sprint.
- Sprint planning
  - Decide how to achieve the sprint goal (design)
  - Create sprint backlog (tasks) from product backlog items (user stories / features)
    - Team selects items from the product backlog they can commit to completing
    - Tasks (Jira "child issues") are identified and each is estimated (1-16 hours)
  - Estimate total sprint backlog in hours.
- Guiding principles
  - Plan collaboratively, not done alone by the ScrumMaster
  - High-level design is considered

### Daily stand-ups

- Parameters:

  - Daily
    15-minutes
    Stand-up.

  - Not for problem solving.

  - These are not status for the ScrumMaster
    or product owner. 

    They are commitments in front of peers.

  - The "whole world" is invited, but...

    - Only team members, ScrumMaster and the product owner, can talk.
    - Helps avoid other unnecessary meetings

- Everyone answers 3 questions:

  - What did you do yesterday?
  - What will you do today?
  - Is anything in your way?

### Sprint Review Meeting

Meeting with client, aka "product owner" (or testers for game dev).

- Team presents what it accomplished during the sprint.
- Typically takes the form of a demo of new features or underlying architecture.
- Informal
  - 2-hour max prep time rule
  - No slides
- Whole team participates
- Invite the world

### Sprint retrospective

Periodically take a look at what is and is not working.

- Typically 15â€“30 minutes.
- Done after every sprint.
- Whole team participates.
  - ScrumMaster
  - Team
  - Possibly product owner, customers and others
- The team discussion focuses on what to:
  - Start doing
  - Stop doing
  - Continue doing
