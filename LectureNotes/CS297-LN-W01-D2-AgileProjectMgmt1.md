# Agile Scrum Review: Beginning a Sprint

This week we will review aspects of the Scrum process that you will need to know as you start your first sprint, this includes the *sprint planning* meeting and the *daily stand-up* meetings.

Next week we will review the *sprint review* meeting and the *sprint retrospective*.

## Scrum Roles

### Product owner

This is your client.

- Define the features of the product.
- Decide on release date and content.
- Be responsible for the profitability of the product (ROI).
- Prioritize features according to market value.
- Adjust features and priority every iteration, as needed.
- Accept or reject work results.

### ScrumMaster

- Represents management (or in the case of this class, your instructor) to the project.
- Responsible for enacting Scrum values and practices.
- Removes impediments.
- Ensures that the team is fully functional and productive.
- Enables close cooperation across all roles and functions.
- Shields the team from external interferences.

### Team

- Typically 5-9 people in the "real world", 2 to 4 in our class.
- Cross-functional:
  Programmers, testers, user experience designers, etc.
- Members should be full-time in the "real world".
- Teams are self-organizing&mdash;Ideally. No titles, but occasionally a possibility (like lead developer).

### Other Stakeholders

- Management (in this class, your instructor)
- End-users
- Investors



## Scrum Meetings

During each sprint you will hold these meetings (aka "ceremonies"):

- At the beginning of the sprint:
  - **Sprint planning**: the team plans the sprint, builds the sprint backlog.
- During the sprint:
  - **Daily standup**: each team member updates the team on their progress.
- At the end of the sprint:
  - **Sprint review**: the team gets feedback about the product from the client.
  - **Sprint retrospective**: the team evaluates what went well and what didn't.

It's best to do this with everyone looking at the backlog and sprints on your agile management software (such as Jira).

### Sprint planning meeting

- Participants
  - ScrumMaster
  - Team
  - Product owner (if available)
- Sprint Prioritization
  - Analyze and evaluate product backlog.
  - Select sprint goal. What feature (or features) will be usable at the end of the sprint.
  - Consult the product owner on priorities if they are not in the planning meeting.
- Sprint planning
  - Decide how to achieve the sprint goal (design)
  - Create sprint backlog (tasks) from product backlog items (user stories / features)
    - Team selects items from the product backlog they can commit to completing
    - Tasks (Jira "child issues") are identified and each is estimated (1-16 hours)
  - Estimate total sprint backlog in hours.
- Guiding principles
  - Plan collaboratively, not done alone by the ScrumMaster.
  - High-level design is considered.
    - Low-level design will be done during the sprint.
    - Consult with the product owner if there are questions about details of the low-level design.



### Daily stand-ups

- Review the Jira sprint backlog.
  - Update the board as each person describes thier work.
  - The scrum master is responsible for esuring the board is up to date.
- Everyone answers 3 questions:
  - What did you do yesterday?
  - What will you do today?
  - Is anything in your way?

- Parameters:
  - Daily
    15-minutes
    Stand-up

  - Not for problem solving or giving advice or opinions.
    (Problem solving can be done one-on-one outide of a team meeting.)

  - These are not status reports for the ScrumMaster
    or product owner. They are commitments in front of peers.

  - The "whole world" is invited, but...

    - Only team members, ScrumMaster and the product owner (if present), can talk.
    - Helps avoid other unnecessary meetings.
