## Plan Team Meetings

Schedule a time and place for each type of team meeting.

  - Options are:

    - Class time is best for this if possible.

    - Working together in person is best if possible.

    - Working remotely, but at the same time while connected with Discord or something similar.

  - Start each work session with a "stand up" meeting.

  - PRs sent.
  - Participation in synchronous team work sessions.
- Each team will report at the end of each sprint:
  - For sprint planning meetings: time, participants, scrum master, time & date planned for product review with client, and issues (if any).
  - For product review meeting with client: time, participants, and feedback.
  - For team retrospective: time, participants, and what you will keep doing, stop doing, start doing.
- Each team's scrum master will ensure that the team keeps the Jira project up to date.
