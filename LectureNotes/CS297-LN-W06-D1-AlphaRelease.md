# Alpha Release

This week you will release your project for alpha testing. Today we will discuss all that is involved in an alpha release.

## What is an Alpha Release?

**Purpose of an alpha release**

- Get early feedback on usability from potential end-users and other stake holders.
- Get bug reports from potential end users as opposed to just testers.
  In this context, we mean that we won't be using just software or game dev type people for testing. We'll be releasing the product to people who are typical of those who we expect to use the product.
- Motivation to get your project to a usable state.

**Characteristics of an alpha release**

- A minimal set of features implemented
   Not all the features will be done, but a minimal set of the most important features will be at least partially working. These features  should be working well enough that users can actually use the application or game in some basic way.
- Still has bugs
  There will be both known and unknown bugs. Give the testers a list of the known bugs.
- You should start using some form of bug tracking at this point 
  You can enter bugs in your agile project management system and identify them as "issues" or "bugs" to distinguish them from *user stories*.

**Real life story**

At Intel Architecture Labs:

- Contrast the testing done by the QA department to alpha testing done by "real world" users.
- E-mail auto-sorting feature that passed QA but failed alpha testing.
