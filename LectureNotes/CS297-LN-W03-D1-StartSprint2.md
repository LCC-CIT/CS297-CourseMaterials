## Intro

### Reminders

Everyone should have submitted their individual progress reports and team meeting reports yesterday.

### Sprint 1 Retrospective

Common issues that have come up in the first retrospective:

- Merging to the main without a PR.
- Timely review of PRs.
- Code freeze a day before the product review.
- Update the domain model UML class diagram as you make revisions.
- Estimate story points in sprint planning and keep track of actual hours when completing them.
- Others?

## Sprint 2 Overview

You should now have completed your first sprint, deployed your web app to a staging server, had your product review meeting with your client and your team retrospective meeting.

## Sprint Planning

If you haven't already today is the time to have your planning meeting for sprint two. If you client is available, it's great to have them there for the first part of the meeting when you put user stories into the sprint 2 backlog. If you knew the client wasn't available, you could discuss priorities for sprint 2 and the sprint 1 product review meeting.
