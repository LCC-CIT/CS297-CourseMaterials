# Alpha Release Presentation Guide

Your presentation should be 15 to 20 minutes long. The times listed in the headings below are suggestions.

## Overview of the Project - 2 minutes

Refresh eveyone's memory of the "big picure" of the project.
(Most of the class members will have already heard about the project during your System Design presentation.)

- Who is the client.
- What is the purpose of the site.

## Demonstration of your web site - 5 minutes

Suggested points:

- Show everything you have working so far.
- Highlight any features you are especially proud of.
- Tell us about any features that were especially hard to implement.

## Evaluation of the Design - 2 minutes

Assess the design you did in CS246 (last term). Suggested points:

- Was the design complete enough?

- Were there shortcomings in the design?

- What parts of the design have you changed so far?

- What would you do differently next time you design a web app?

## Evaluation of the development process - 3 minutes

Describe what has been going well, what hasn't gone well, and  what you would do differently in the future. Suggested topics:

- Communication with your client.
- Team collaboration.
- Project management.
- Writing the code.

## Evaluation of the finished product - 5 minutes

1. Assessment of the completeness of your application. 

   - What percentage of the essential features are implemented so far?
   - How satisfied is your client?

2. Assessment of the implementation.

   - Will the code be easy to maintain? (Will it be easy to fix bugs and add new features).

     - Explain why it will and/or will not be easy to maintain.

   - To what degree did you follow "best practices" in coding? 

     (Separation of concerns, DRY code, no “dead” code, minimal dependencies, comments, descriptive names, etc.)

   - Do you have enough unit tests?

3. Performance: will your site give good response times when loaded with the expected number of users?

4. Responsiveness: does your site work well for a variety of screen sizes? 

   (Phone, tablet, notebook, desktop.)

5. Results of UX testing.

6. Results of functional testing.

7. How bug-free is your code?

   Possible points to address:

   - Has it been thoroughly tested?
   - Are there known bugs?
   - Does it crash unexpectedly, or does it do strange things at random times?
   - Do you have run-time exception handling?
