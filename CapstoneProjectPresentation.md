**CS297, Programming Capstone**

# Final Presentation Guide

Your presentation should be 15 to 20 minutes long. The times listed in the headings below are suggestions.

## Demonstration of your web site - 5 minutes

Suggested points:

- Show just the basic, core parts of the site.
- Show any features you are especially proud of.
- Show any features that were especially hard to implement.

## Evaluation of the Design - 2 minutes

Assess the design you did in CS246 (last term).

Suggested points:

- Was the design complete enough?

- Were there shortcomings in the design?

- What kinds of things did you change in the design?

- What would you do differently next time you design an app?

## Evaluation of the development process - 3 minutes

Describe what went well, what didn't and what you would do differently in the future. 

Suggested topics:

- Communication with your client.
- Team collaboration.
- Project management.
- Writing the code.

## Evaluation of the finished product - 7 minutes

1. Assessment of the completeness of your application. 

   - Is the software done?

     (Does it do everything the client wants it to do?)

2. Assessment of the implementation of your system.

   - Will the code be easy to maintain?

     (Easy to: fix bugs and add new features).

   - To what degree did you follow "best practices" in coding? 

     (Separation of concerns, DRY code, no “dead” code, minimal dependencies, comments, descriptive names, etc.)

   - Do you have enough unit tests?

3. ~~Performance: will your code run fast?~~

   ~~(For example, will your database support a heavy load of users?)~~

4. How bug-free is your code?

   Possible points to address:

   - Has it been thoroughly tested?
   - Are there known bugs?
   - Does it crash unexpectedly, or does it do strange things at random times?
   - Do you have run-time exception handling?
