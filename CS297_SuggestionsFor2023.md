# Suggestions for Next Year's Class (2023)

[TOC]



## Week 1

Revise the "Intro to course" lecture notes

- Break into two files:
  -  Intro to course--about how the class is like the real world and what we hope they will learn and how this is important to employers.
  - Overview of syllabus, grading and individual time reporting

Revise the sprint meetings lecture notes

- Break into two files
  - One for daily stand-ups and sprint planning and reporting on those.
  - One for the rest of the meetings (sprint review and team retrospective) and reporting on those.
    - Give this lecture in **week 2** since that's when they will do these meetings.
