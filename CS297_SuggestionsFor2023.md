# Suggestions for Next Year's Class (2023)

[TOC]



## Week 1

Revise the "Intro to course" lecture notes

- Break into two files:
  -  Intro to course--about how the class is like the real world and what we hope they will learn and how this is important to employers.
  - Overview of syllabus, grading and individual time reporting

Revise the sprint meetings lecture notes

- Break into two files
  - One for daily stand-ups and sprint planning and reporting on those.
  - One for the rest of the meetings (sprint review and team retrospective) and reporting on those.
    - Give this lecture in **week 2** since that's when they will do these meetings.

## Week 2

Review unit testing. Talk about:

-  Why we use the repository pattern. 

- Why some people use the Unit of Work pattern.  

  > The goal of the unit of work pattern is to simplify DML (Data Manipulation Language) in your code and only commit changes to the database/objects when it's truly time to commit. &mdash;https://github.com/Coding-With-The-Force/Salesforce-Separation-Of-Concerns-And-The-Apex-Common-Library/wiki/05)-The-Unit-of-Work-Pattern

- What should be tested and why query code should usually be in controllers and not in repositories.

- Test Driven Development and "test first".

Require a graded submission of the unit testing project.
