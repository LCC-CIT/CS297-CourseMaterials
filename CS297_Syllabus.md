[TOC]

## Course Description

This course is an advanced course in programming methods with an emphasis on applying best practices for software development in the  context of a development team. The course ties together topics covered in the first and second years of curriculum. It emphasizes practical application and working knowledge and is project oriented. Students will work together in teams to produce a  moderately complex software application (or system) and prepare it for release to end users. 



## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course you will be able to:    

1. Analyze, design and implement a medium scale, but significant programming project.
2. Demonstrate an ability to integrate knowledge and skills acquired in previous coursework.
3. Demonstrate the ability to work as an effective member of a project team. 
           



## Learning Resources

### Texts  

No textbook is required 

### Moodle Course

All course activities and resources will be managed through this class; Moodle page. Assignment instructions will be made available on Moodle by the instructor and assignments will be submitted via Moodle by the students. 

### Software

Licenses for all software and hosting platforms used for development (Visual Studio, Unity, Azure, Git, issue tracking, project  management, etc.) will be provided at no cost to students. 



## Assessment and Grading

Since one of the main objectives for this class is to learn to  produce a major software project as a team, half your grade will be based on the work done by your team. The other half of your grade will  be based on an assessment of your contribution to the team project. Since your main activity is to work with your team, we meet together for eight hours a week so team members can collaborate with each other and get help from the instructor effectively. In addition,  you should budget at least six hours a week for work outside of class time. 



| Assessment Activities                  |Percentage of grade |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| <u>Team</u> | 50% |
| - Team assignments | |
| - Capstone project | |
| <u>Individual</u> |50% |
| - Individual assignments | |
| - Participation with your team | |
| - Git pull requests created | |
| - Completed agile user stories | |
| - Class[^1] and team meeting attendance | |
| - Hours worked <br />(A minimum of 12 hours per week including class time) | |



 Letter grades for the course will be determined by the following percentages:        

| Grade | -        |       | +      |
| ----- | -------- | ----- | ------ |
| A     | 90–91    | 92–97 | 98–100 |
| B     | 80–81    | 82–87 | 88–89  |
| C     | 70–71    | 72–77 | 78–79  |
| D     | 60–61    | 62–67 | 68–69  |
| F     | Below 60 |       |        |



### Late Work

- The grade for assignments will be reduced 10% if they are submitted late. 
- The final project is due at the time scheduled for the final exam.
- Exceptions will be made only for illness or serious emergency situations. 

### Academic Honesty 

Students will be trusted to accurately report their class and  team participation, Git pull requests, and records of work  completed in their team’s project management system. 

### Attendance

Attendance is both required and graded. The main activity you  will do in this class is the work you do with your team, you need to be  present with your team to do that work effectively. 

#### No-Show Drop

LCC has a [no-show drop](https://www.lanecc.edu/esfs/noshow-drops) policy which means that during the first week of the term, to avoid  being dropped, a student must attend at least one class session.
